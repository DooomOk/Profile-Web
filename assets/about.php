            <p>Hello, I'm Jules Bumatay, but you can call me "Dom." 
               I am a 2nd-year BSIT student at National University Fairview. 
               While I don't particularly enjoy studying, it's a necessity I can't ignore. 
               In my free time, I love playing the guitar and reading manga. Additionally, 
               I am a member of a band, where I serve as a rhythm guitarist. 
               I am also proficient in playing bass and piano.</p>
